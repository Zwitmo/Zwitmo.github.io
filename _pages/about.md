This is Zimu Wang's home on the web!

I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Actuarial Science at Hunan University, with an expected graduation date of July 2026. By that time, I will be awarded a Bachelor of Economics degree. Throughout my undergraduate studies, my research interests lie in Bayesian statistical inference, actuarial modeling and machine learning.
